In this project you will discover how to effectively use the Keras library in your machine learning to predict binary classification classes.

## Getting Started

### Description of the Dataset
Dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a sequence of word indexes (integers). For convenience, words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so that for instance the integer "3" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data. This allows for quick filtering operations such as: "only consider the top 10,000 most common words, but eliminate the top 20 most common words".

### What we achieved doing this Project for the Navy:
In this post, you discovered the three API styles used in Keras Deep Learning library in Python.

You learned how you can work through a binary classification problem step-by-step with Keras, specifically:

+	How to load and prepare data for use in Keras.
+	How to create a baseline neural network model.
+	How data preparation schemes can lift the performance of your models.
+	How experiments adjusting the network topology can lift model performance.
